## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- vanilla javascript
- Scss
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This practice really reminded me that I am still an unskilled JavaScript learner! When I first saw the active animation in this exercise, I had no idea what to do. It required using the DOM concepts I had learned, but despite watching many online classes, I still have little actual practice. The biggest challenge I encountered was recalling my knowledge and applying it correctly.

### Continued development

JavaScript is the core programming language for web development, and while it is challenging, it is also fun! I can't wait to move on to the next JavaScript practice and learn new things!
